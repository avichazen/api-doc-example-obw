General Putnam Motel Diner API  - Proof of Concept for App

## Introduction
The owners of General Putnam Motel Diner are creating an app so that their patrons can order their meals as Corona has caused the diner to close its doors to the public. Using the app, customers will be able to place take-out orders. 
In the future, the management wants to put the app on a tablet so that patrons can order from their seats in the diner (once the diner opens to the public). The application will interface with the server-side ordering system which is sitting in the kitchen and prints out orders for the cooks. The API is used to interface between the app and the server.
Our company has been requested to provide a POC (proof of concept) for the app. If General Putnam Motel Diner management approves POC, they will pay for the final app.
