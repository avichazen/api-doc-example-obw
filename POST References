# POST Reference Guide
For the full version of the App, this section will be expanded to include additional order items. For the purpose of this POC, only the burger meal is documented. The burger JSON object is included in the POST request which is sent to the kitchen. When an OK response is received, the order is printed in the kitchen so the cook can start cooking.
The General Putnam Motel Diner API contains the following POST references:
